OSS 4 for Debian
----------------

The OSS 4.0 API is backward compatible with applications developed
for previous API versions. Since OSS is based on the Posix/Unix
system call interface, there is no library code that could cause
dependency problems with different library versions.

This makes it possible to get 10 years old programs to work with
the latest OSS version without recompiling (provided that the program
doesn't depend on undocumented features).

Equally it's possible to use an application compiled against
the very latest OSS header in a system that runs some 10 years old driver.
This is of course only possible if that application doesn't use
the new ioctl calls.
